      text: "Letting someone into your home to clean it is a big decision. The price matters, but it's rarely what makes or breaks the experience. What matters is whether they turn up when they say they will, clean to the same standard every time, look after your home, and fix things if they get something wrong. Ask the right questions before you book and you'll know which cleaner is going to deliver – and which one will leave you looking again in a month.",

Without it, you may be left to sort it out yourself. It's reasonable to ask for a copy of the business's certificate of currency, which proves the policy is current.",
